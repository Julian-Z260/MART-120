The final project I want to try and create is a simple maze game on html.  I've struggled for a long time trying to figure out how to make a live link for projects in this class and I think I'll struggle agtain for this one. However, I will do my best trying to ensure that the project is up to my standards.  I have been working on it since we got the assignment in our 
canvas portal as well as the extra credit for this course.  I don't really have any major deadlines for myself other than when the project is actually due.  I don't have any real examples or inspiration for this project, in all honesty I was brainstorming and my buddy walked in and suggested the maze game and I thought it would be a great idea.
  Overall this project has been a struggle for me to try and create but so far it isn't all that rough.  I am most of the way there and I do hope that I can complete it before the deadline.
Thank you for reading, Julian D. Zires.
